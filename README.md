# Introduction

This solution provides the possibility to detect changes in the magnetic field around the sensors that can be interpreted as parking cars. It stores data, processes it, and sends info when the magnetic field conditions are changing.
It is communicating with the use of LORAWAN and sending data to TheThingsNetwork where it is processed and interpreted to show it to the people.
